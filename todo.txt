    2. Clean up files:
        crud.py - condense or clear redundant or unused functions
        server.py - condense redundant routes and code in view functions
        macros.html - redo macro for forms to accomodate edit forms
        JS folder - condense or clear redundant or unused functions

    3. Review and compare create forms and edit forms to find if combining would be better implementation.

    4. Code review to find where AJAX could be implemented.
